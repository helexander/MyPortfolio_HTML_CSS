# MyPortfolio_HTML_CSS

This is my first draft portfolio. The project is created with HTML and CSS (utilising the knowledge gained after two weeks of lessons with _nology). It should contain:

- Landing page/section
- About page/section
- Tech Stack page/section
- Project page/section
- Contact page/section

This is the current wireframe of my portfolio (created with Figma):
